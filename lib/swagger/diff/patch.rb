# Workaround for Swagger::V2::SecurityScheme[1] incorrectly specifying
# required fields. maxlinc is right: the Swagger specification[2] is
# misleading. Fixed Fields suggests many parameters are required that are not
# required by Swagger's official validator[3]. Working around this by removing
# them from the array of required properties.
